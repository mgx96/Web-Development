<h1>Malek's All Time Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>As an aviation nerd, this movie was an absoulte banger!! It captures the feel of being inside the cockpit of a real fighter jet and very realistically conveys the different flying tactics and manuevers</p>
<h3>Purple Hearts</h3>
<p>In the midst of the politically charged division in the U.S between republicans and democrats, this movie depicts that we, as americans, can co-exist and live in harmony despite our political differences. I beleive we need more of these movies to spread postivity and ease the tension between people on both sides of the aisle</p>
<h3>Any Veteran Movies</h3>
<p>This might not qualify as a legitmate answer but it's true. The movies that shed some light on the sacrifices that our veterans have made in order to protect our nation are ones that I deeply admire, some more than others, but I geniunely beleive that we are unaware of the horrors these brave men and women go through to protect and serve their fellow Americans</p>
